This repository has been created for Problem Set 6 of STATS 507. The contents of this repository include:
* my solution to Problem Set 2, Question 3 for Statistics 507. The file can be found [here](ps2q3.ipynb). 
* two problem sets that have been corrected in hopes of receiving points back. (507ps#.ipynb)
* my notes created for Question 0 of Problem Set 4 for use in the fan-out tree.

The solution file for Problem Set 2, Question 3 extracts data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (administered by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) from the years 2011 to 2018. Specifically, I create two datasets; one for demographics information, and one for oral health examination information. After extracting this data directly from the NHANES website, I select my desired variables from each of these dataframes, then clean the variables by renaming them and converting columns to appropriate datatypes. The script then finally saves the cleaned dataframes in a pickle format to the local directory.
